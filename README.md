## How does the bot work?
Invite the bot and mention it, it will delete all the previous channels/categories and make new ones.

## How to use the code?
Just copy your bot's [token], paste it in the last line of [bot.py] and run the code. Your bot will stay online as long as the execution terminal isnt closed. If you want the bot to send the rules, you can edit them in line 6 of [bot.py].

## Why does my bot go offline?
You have to host tour bot in order for it to run 24/7. [This is a good guide on how to do that.]
